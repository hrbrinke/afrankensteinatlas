<p>The women in Victor Frankenstein’s life represent his anchor points to normality. His mother, Justine, and, most importantly, Elizabeth are his ties to family life and his own humanity. As he loses each of these women, he loses a piece of his humanity, eventually becoming driven by revenge alone and reduced to the level of the monster that he’s created.
